    question: "What even is TWIQ AI and how is it different from ChatGPT?",
    answer:
      "TWIQ AI is a specialized storytelling and content intelligence platform built for bold, purpose-driven brands. While ChatGPT is general-purpose, TWIQ AI is trained on our proprietary TWIQ Method to help you create emotionally intelligent content that builds trust, positions your expertise, and turns ideas into influence. Think of it as your personal brand strategist in bot form.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who is this platform actually built for?",
    answer:
      "Coaches, c-suite executives, consultants, founders, service providers, content creators, and thought leaders who are tired of sounding like everyone else. If you‚Äôve got something meaningful to say but need help saying it in a way that converts without the cringe, TWIQ AI was made for you.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does the TWIQ Method stand for again?",
    answer:
      "TWIQ = T: Thought Leadership Content, W: What-To-Do Content (practical, tangible advice), I: Ideal Identity Connection Content, Q: Quick Help Content (actionable, immediate value). It‚Äôs the blueprint for content that connects, educates, and converts, without burning you out.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I actually use the TWIQ bots?",
    answer:
      "Each bot comes with easy conversation starters or prompt templates. You plug in your goal, tone, topic, and target audience. The bots generate high-impact content like carousels, captions, video scripts, storytelling scripts, blog posts etc. It‚Äôs structured to feel intuitive, fast, and fun, even if you ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do content.‚Äù",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I still sound like me using AI?",
    answer:
      "Yes. That‚Äôs kind of the point. TWIQ AI is trained to pull out your lived experience, voice, values, and vibe, so your content still feels like you, but with more clarity and strategy behind it. No soulless templates here.",
  },

  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to be ‚Äútechy‚Äù to use this?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely not. If you can send a voice note or type a DM, you can use this platform. It‚Äôs designed to feel like you‚Äôre chatting with a smart bestie who just happens to know marketing, brand psychology, and how to write copy that hits.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will this work if I have multiple offers or niches?",
    answer:
      "Yes. TWIQ is built for multi-passionate humans who don‚Äôt fit neatly in one box. The bots help you clarify your content pillars so you can speak to different aspects of your brand without confusing your audience.",
  },

  },
  {
    question: "What‚Äôs one thing I should do before using TWIQ AI?",
    answer:
      "Come with a clear intention. Whether it‚Äôs building visibility, launching a new offer, or clarifying your voice‚Äîwhen you know what you‚Äôre trying to say or achieve, the bots will help you get there faster and more powerfully.",
